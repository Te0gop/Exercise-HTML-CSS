<p>Posted by <strong>Laura Jones</strong> on Monday, June 21st 2027</p>

<p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and
    JavaScript.
    These are the languages of the web.</p>

<p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

<p><strong>What is HTML?</strong></p>

<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe
    the
    content of a webpage (not a programming language).

    HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc.
    Web
    browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.

    In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The opening tag</li>
    <li>The closing tag</li>
    <li>The actual element</li>
</ol>

<strong>Why should you learn HTML?</strong>

<p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:
<ul>
    <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
    <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
    <li>To build web applications</li>
    <li>To impress friends</li>
    <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
</ul>
Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!
